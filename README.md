# Craken

Cracken is a parser combinator library heavily influenced by Hutton and Meijer's [Monadic Parser Combinators](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf)

Cracken is currently under development

Like the ideam, but want a different library? \
Check out [Sprache](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache). It's based on the same paper! \
Check out [Pidgin](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Pidgin) if you want a feature rich, speed focused library
